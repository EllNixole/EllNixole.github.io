            </div>
            <p>Hello, I'm Dani, the passionate baker and creative mind behind Cakes By Dani!

                Baking and decorating cakes have been my lifelong passions, and I'm thrilled to share my sweet creations 
                with you. As a one-person business, every cake that leaves my kitchen is crafted with love and 
                dedication, ensuring that you receive not just a cake, but a work of art that adds a touch of magic 
                to your special moments.
                <br></br>
                
                My journey into the world of baking began as a hobby, baking treats for family and friends. 
                Their encouragement and delight in my creations inspired me to turn my passion into a small business. 
                <br></br>
                
                Your celebration is unique, and I'm here to create a cake that perfectly complements your special
                 occasion. Whether it's a whimsical birthday cake or a delightful 
                 anniversary surprise, I love collaborating with you to bring your vision to life. 
                 Your joy and satisfaction are what fuel my creativity!
            </p>
